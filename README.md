## Frameworks for Building Gen AI Apps:

Gen AI apps uses the power of generative models to:

  - Create new content
  - Answer questions in an informative way
  - Automate Tasks
  etc.

To build generative AI (GenAI) applications, developers can choose from a variety of frameworks such as:

### Deep Learning Frameworks:
  1.TensorFlow:
    - open-source framework by Google
    - used for building and deploying complex machine learning models.
    - excellent for handling intricate neural networks.
    
  2. PyTorch:
    - open-source framework by Meta
    - known for its user-friendly interface, dynamic computation graphs, easier debugging of complex models.
     
### Generative AI-Specific Frameworks:
  1. LangChain:
    - open-source framework designed specifically for GenAI
    - simplifies integration with LLMs through standardized interfaces for agents, memory, and chains.
    - used for text generation, chatbot functionalities etc.
     
### Application Development Frameworks:
  1. Gradio & Streamlit:
    - lightweight, easy-to-use frameworks
    - help developers quickly build user interfaces for GenAI applications
    - offering pre-built components for user interaction and model integration.
